We provide the following files required for execution:
- D501nm.m and D601nm.m: D50 and D60 Illuminants
- CalibrationWhiteReference.m: MatLab file for adjusting the white calibration
- Observer.txt: response of the CIE 2ยบ standard observer to light, containing the wavelengths and the corresponding color matching functions (X, Y, Z)

You will need to create a folder with these files and the executable.
In a subfolder, you need to store the 6 Hyperspectral ENVI files: raw, whiteReference and darkReference (data and header for each one of them)
Important: If your files are named differently, rename them to: raw, whiteReference and darkReference. Do NOT change the extension "hdr" of the header files.
